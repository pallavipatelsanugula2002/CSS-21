        <h1 class="haha">Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>
        <img src="t1img.jpeg" id="add">
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents 
            designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>
            It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) <br>and 
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local 
            storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
             HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p><br>

        <h1 class="haha">Cascading Style Sheet</h1>
                <div id="adddd"><img src="t2img.jpeg" alt="img"></div>
                <p >CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets<br>
                    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media<br>
                    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once<br>
                    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p><br><hr>

                    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the <br>World Wide Web,
                     alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side <br>for webpage behavior,[10] 
                     often incorporating third-party libraries.<br> 
                    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>
        
                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br> 
                    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
